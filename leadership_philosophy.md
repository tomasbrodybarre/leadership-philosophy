\### Leadership principles for building high performing growth-oriented teams



My approach to leadership is centered on a core belief: strong, high-performing teams emerge when the right people are in the right environment. Therefore, the role of a leader is to find the right people and to provide them with the environment where they can thrive. To this end, I let four core principles determine both how I hire and how I develop a team culture: Generosity, Loyalty, Honesty, and Challenge.



\#### 1. Generosity: Seeding Success



Generosity is a proactive commitment to every team member’s growth and well-being.



\* \*\*Sharing Knowledge\*\*: I believe in the free flow of information. New tools, methods, or insights are shared immediately to elevate the entire team. Knowledge is never hoarded or gatekept.



\* \*\*Removing Obstacles\*\*: I willingly take on small inconveniences to create large gains for my team, whether that means reviewing code, editing a presentation, or sending an email to clear an organizational obstacle.



\* \*\*Architecting Careers\*\*: I work to understand the unique strengths and ambitions of each team member. I then actively create and assign projects that not only serve the company’s goals but also move my people along their desired career trajectory.



\#### 2. Loyalty: Creating a Safe Harbor



Loyalty is a non-negotiable principle that a leader must demonstrate before they can ask it of others. My team knows I have their back, unconditionally.



\* \*\*Shielding the Team\*\*: I insulate my team from unnecessary organizational politics and friction, allowing them to focus on doing their best work.



\* \*\*Accepting the Blame, Sharing the Credit\*\*: When things go wrong, the buck stops with me. When they go right, the credit belongs to the team. I never, ever throw a team member under the bus.



\* \*\*Genuine Care\*\*: My support for my team is rooted in a genuine desire to see them succeed and thrive, both professionally and personally.



\#### 3. Honesty: Enabling Growth Through Direct Feedback



Generosity and Loyalty build the trust and psychological safety required for true honesty. Because my team knows I am fundamentally for them, I earn the right to deliver direct, unvarnished feedback.



\* \*\*Constructively Direct\*\*: Feedback is always delivered clearly and honestly, but never aggressively or cruelly. It's a tool to build people up, not tear them down.



\* \*\*Always Actionable\*\*: Honest feedback is useless without a path forward. Every critique is paired with a clear plan for remediation and a commitment of my support to help them execute it. This transforms difficult conversations into catalysts for growth.



\#### 4. Challenge: Aligning Ambition with Opportunity



With a foundation of safety and trust, we can embrace the discomfort required for real growth. My role is to challenge the team purposefully.



\* \*\*Clarity-Driven Challenge\*\*: Challenges are never arbitrary. They arise from the clear intersection of an individual's career aspirations and a tangible business need.



\* \*\*Comfort with Discomfort\*\*: I cultivate an environment where the team understands that growth feels uncomfortable. We learn to embrace that feeling, knowing it’s a sign of progress.



\* \*\*The Partnership\*\*: I frame every challenge as a partnership: "This will be difficult, but it is the path to where you want to go. I will be here to support you every step of the way." This alignment turns pressure into a powerful motivator.



\#### Hiring Practices



These same principles that inform my management style also apply directly to how I hire. While technical excellence is a given, I prioritize identifying candidates who will thrive in and contribute to this culture. I look for candidates who have a history of lifting up their team mates (Generosity and Loyalty), who are accountable for their work (Honesty) and who are inherently motivated to push themselves to grow (Challenge). My goal isn't just to fill a role, but to find individuals who are excited to help build a remarkable team.
